<h1 align="center"\>Payroll System</h1>

## Overview

This project develops a modern Payroll System designed to calculate and manage employee salaries, wages, and related deductions efficiently. The system offers high flexibility to accommodate various calculation conditions, adapting to different payment cycles and rules, including accurate processing of taxes, social security, and provident funds. It also facilitates easy data storage, flexible salary payment configurations, and seamless integration with banks for direct transfers.

## CRUD Database Design

The database design for the Payroll System primarily focuses on **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations to manage employee information, work time records, salary details, deductions, and payment history. This emphasis ensures robust data management and transactional integrity across key entities like `users`, `employees`, `work_time`, `salary`, `payment_history`, and `transactions`.

## UML Diagrams

The project includes UML diagrams to help understand the system's structure and functionality:

  * **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**: Illustrates the flow of data within the payroll system at various levels.
  * **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: Shows the database structure and relationships between different entities.
  * **Use Case Diagram**: Depicts the system's functionalities and the interacting users.
